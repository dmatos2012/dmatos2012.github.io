Hello there, 

My name is David Matos. I am currently working in [Track32](https://www.track32.nl/) as an Cloud/AI Software Engineer.


I have been recently more interested in  learning how to optimize workflows in `AI` pipelines,and how to speed up deep learning pipelines with `Python`, `Rust`, and/or `C`, rather than training deep learning myself. 

Additionally, I started being interested in developing back-end for web apps, be it showing results of analysis with `SQL` queries within our AWS services, or creating the `API` interactions for internal dashboards. 

You can check some of my [open source contributions]({{site.url}}/projects/oss-contributions), and full list of [projects]({{site.url}}/projects), along with some of the older [deep learning hobby projects]({{site.url}}/projects/dl-hobby-projects) I created earlier. 


You can also download my [CV]({{ site.url }}/documents/DavidMatos_Base_CV.pdf).
