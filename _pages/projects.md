## PointRCNN detections with ROS
* Implementation of SoA object detection in the KITTI dataset with ROS. 

* Detections are visualized in LiDAR and camera space using RVIZ.

## CityScapes Semantic Segmentation
* Implemented network on which multiple experiments were performed such as changing optimizers, using regularization and changing input images to network

* Google Cloud training on CityScapes dataset

## Robust Semantic Segmentation

* Implemented network on which we used the Synthia Dataset to do robust semantic segmentation. On there, we tested whether different data augmentation techniques such as Gamma, flip, saturation among others improved the network's performance.

* Google Cloud training on CityScapes dataset

## Kaggle Speech Recognition

* Implemented network which consisted of correctly classifying 1-second audio files using CNN. 

* Audio files were converted to spectrogram to be used as input to the CNN.

* Submited result to the [Kaggle speech recognition challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/overview)
